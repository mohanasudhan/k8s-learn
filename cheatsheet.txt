### Kubernetes Basics:
- **Pod**: Basic unit of deployment, represents one or more containers deployed together.
- **Namespace**: Virtual cluster within a physical cluster, used to partition resources.
- **Deployment**: Manages Pods using ReplicaSets, ensures desired number of Pods are running.
- **Service**: Abstracts Pod functionality, provides a stable IP address and DNS name.
- **ReplicaSet**: Ensures a specified number of Pod replicas are running at any given time.
- **StatefulSet**: Manages stateful applications, such as databases, with stable, unique network identifiers.
- **DaemonSet**: Ensures a copy of a Pod is running on each node in the cluster.
- **Job**: Runs a task to completion, useful for batch processing and one-off jobs.
- **CronJob**: Runs Jobs on a time-based schedule.

### Kubernetes CLI (`kubectl`) Commands:
- **`kubectl get <resource>`**: List resources.
- **`kubectl describe <resource> <name>`**: Describe a specific resource.
- **`kubectl create -f <file>`**: Create a resource from a file.
- **`kubectl apply -f <file>`**: Create or update a resource based on the file.
- **`kubectl delete <resource> <name>`**: Delete a resource.
- **`kubectl logs <pod_name>`**: Print the logs of a Pod.
- **`kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- <command>`**: Execute a command in a Pod.
- **`kubectl port-forward <pod_name> <local_port>:<remote_port>`**: Forward ports to a Pod.
- **`kubectl scale <resource> <name> --replicas=<count>`**: Scale a resource.

### YAML Configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: mypod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: mycontainer
    image: nginx:latest
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: mydeployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: myapp
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: myapp
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mycontainer
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### Kubernetes Networking:
- **ClusterIP**: Exposes a Service on a cluster-internal IP, only reachable from within the cluster.
- **NodePort**: Exposes a Service on each node's IP at a static port, accessible from outside the cluster.
- **LoadBalancer**: Exposes a Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer.
- **Ingress**: Exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to Services within the cluster.

### Kubernetes Security:
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Defines access policies using roles and role bindings.
- **Network Policies**: Define how groups of Pods are allowed to communicate with each other and other network endpoints.
- **Secrets**: Store sensitive data, such as passwords and OAuth tokens, securely in the cluster.

### Monitoring and Logging:
- **Prometheus**: Open-source monitoring system with a dimensional data model, query language, and alerting.
- **Grafana**: Open-source analytics and monitoring solution for visualizing metrics.
- **ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)**: Used for log aggregation, searching, and visualization.

### Helm:
- **Helm**: Package manager for Kubernetes, simplifies deploying and managing applications.
- **Charts**: Packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, easily shareable and reusable.

### Cluster Management:
- **Kubernetes Dashboard**: Web-based UI for managing and monitoring Kubernetes clusters.
- **kubeadm**: Tool for bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters.
- **Kops**: Tool for managing production-grade Kubernetes clusters.

### Troubleshooting:
- **`kubectl get events`**: Display cluster events.
- **`kubectl describe <resource> <name>`**: Get detailed information about a resource.
- **`kubectl logs <pod_name>`**: Retrieve logs from a Pod.
- **`kubectl exec -it <pod_name> -- <command>`**: Execute a command in a running Pod.

### Best Practices:
- Use labels and selectors effectively for grouping and querying resources.
- Ensure proper resource limits and requests for Pods.
- Regularly monitor cluster health, resource usage, and application performance.
- Implement automated testing and CI/CD pipelines for reliable application delivery.
- Apply security best practices such as RBAC, network policies, and secrets management.
